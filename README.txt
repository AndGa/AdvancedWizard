AdvancedWizard is a WinForms .Net control first written in back in 2002/2003 as an exercise
to help me learn C#. Whilst the code shows many things that today I would do differently due to obviously much more experience and newer language features that weren't available back then, I'm still happy to release this as it serves a useful purpose, works well and includes design-time IDE support.

Hope you find it useful.

I have finally brought the code up to a more modern standard taking advantage of C# 7.0 features in particular
